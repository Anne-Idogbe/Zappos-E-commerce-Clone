      <p className="mb-4">
        Warm yourself up with women's scarves that double as statement pieces to match your look and lifestyle. Find the scarf you need from our expansive collection of sizes, styles, and colors, whether for warmth, sun protection, or religious purposes. Snuggle up to winter scarves for extra cold weather, and <a href="#" className="underline text-black">Women's Bandanas</a> to hold your hair in place.

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">All season coverage</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Decide your purpose, then choose from women's <a href="#" className="underline text-black">Wraps</a> and headscarves in different sizes and various fabrics. Some travel-friendly pieces are larger to easily wrap around the body, and are thicker to withstand colder climates. For days with just a slight chill, cover your head or neck with a square scarf. Look through ideal coverage for cyclists, runners, or joggers, like <a href="#" className="underline text-black">Neck Gaiters</a>, that keep you warm during cold days and shield you from the sun's UV rays. Many sport-related variants feature moisture-wicking, breathable fabrics to keep your neck dry. Folded into a triangle or lengthwise, bandanas keep your hair away from your face, which is especially useful when doing manual labor, or spending time outdoors in windy or hot weather.

        Infinity scarves combine style and comfort. The continuous loop design allows you to manipulate it into the form that best fits your need to feel cozy, and makes a unique fashion statement. A neckerchief is another function-meets-form piece that keeps your neck warm while giving your attire a unique twist. Aside from keeping warmth, traditional <a href="#" className="underline text-black">Shawls</a> made of wool complete customary or religious attire. Whether plain or intricately patterned, they cover the head or hang on the shoulders for aesthetics or symbolism.
